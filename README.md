# Localization, Pose Estimation and Visual Odometry Using Visual Tags
An USC Race On Project using AprilTags and OpenCV

**Fall 2020:**
- Developed ATDetector class that contains AprilTag visualization and pose estimation functions
- Wrote Markdown lessons on Fisheye Camera Calibration and Pose Esimation using AprilTags for future Race On Workshops
- Created Jupyter Notebook demo of ATDetector functionality and visualization of pose estimation accuracy (or lack there-of)

**Spring 2020: In Progress** 
- Using Kalman Filtering to improve localization accuracy by utilizing prior knowledge of vehicle model.
- Creating visual odometry scripts that use either AprilTags or ML-based feature point extraction (or maybe both!)
